  {
    question: "What does 'compostable' mean for restaurant supplies?",
    answer: "Compostable products meet ASTM D6400 or D6868 standards and break down into organic matter within 90-180 days in commercial composting facilities. They must be certified by BPI (Biodegradable Products Institute) to ensure they truly decompose without leaving harmful residues.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between compostable and biodegradable?",
    answer: "Compostable products meet specific timeframes and conditions for breakdown (typically 90-180 days in commercial facilities). Biodegradable simply means it breaks down eventually, but may take years and isn't regulated. Always choose BPI-certified compostable for true environmental impact.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will compostable containers hold up for hot and cold foods?",
    answer: "Yes! Modern compostable containers are engineered for performance. Bagasse (sugarcane fiber) handles hot foods and liquids up to 200¬∞F. PLA-lined products work for cold items. They perform as well as traditional plastic but break down in composting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are eco-friendly products more expensive?",
    answer: "Sustainable products typically cost 10-30% more than traditional plastic, but prices have dropped significantly. Many customers are willing to pay slightly more for eco-friendly options, and bulk ordering reduces the premium. Consider it an investment in brand values.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer custom printing on eco-friendly packaging?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We can custom print on compostable containers, cups, and bags with soy-based or water-based inks that maintain compostability. Minimum orders start at 2,500 units. Show your sustainability commitment while building your brand.",
