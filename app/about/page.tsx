            <h2 className="text-3xl font-heading font-bold text-ink mb-4">Our Story</h2>
            <p className="text-ink-muted mb-6">
              Restaurant Supplies Direct was created to solve a simple problem: independent restaurants and small hospitality businesses deserve the same access to quality supplies and wholesale pricing as large restaurant groups.
            </p>
            <p className="text-ink-muted mb-6">
              While the big players had dedicated distributors and account reps, smaller operators were left paying retail prices at local supply shops or navigating confusing online marketplaces.
            </p>
            <p className="text-ink-muted mb-8">
              We're changing that by bringing institutional-quality supplies, transparent pricing, and white-glove service directly to every operator — whether you're running one location or one hundred.
            </p>
